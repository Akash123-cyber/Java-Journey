Class Variable
➢ Class variables are also known as static variables. 
➢ Variable  which  are  declared  in  a  class,  but  outside  a  method, 
constructor  or  a  block  and  qualified  with  ‘static’  keyword  are 
known as class variables.
➢ Only  one  copy  of  each  class  variable  is  created,  regardless  of 
how many objects are created from it.
➢ Static variables can be accessed by calling with the class name. 
 ClassName.VariableName


➢ Static  variables  are  created  with  the  start  of  execution  of  a 
program and destroyed when the program terminates.
➢ Default values are same as instance variables. 
➢ A public static final variable behaves as a CONSTANT in Java. 
➢ They are stored in special heap area which is known as 
PermGen(Permanent Generation)-In Java 5 and 6
➢ In  Java  8  PermGen  is  replaced  with  new  terminology,  known 
as “MetaSpace”
➢ The main reason for this change of PermGen in Java 8.0 is that 
it  is  tough  to  predict  the  size  of  PermGen,  and  it  helps  in 
improving garbage collection performance.
