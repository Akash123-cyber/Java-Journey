# Access Modifiers in Abstract Classes and Methods

Every access modifier (public, protected, private, and default/package-private) can be used for abstract methods and abstract classes, but their usage depends on the visibility requirements of your code. Let's break down how each access modifier can be applied to abstract methods and classes.

## 1. Public Access Modifier (public)

### Abstract Class

When you declare an abstract class as public, it can be accessed from any other class, regardless of the package.

```java
public abstract class Animal {
    // abstract class is accessible everywhere
}
```

### Abstract Method

When an abstract method is declared public, it must be implemented by any non-abstract subclass, and the implementation will be accessible from anywhere.

```java
public abstract class Animal {
    public abstract void makeSound();
}
```

**Note:** `makeSound()` must be implemented by any subclass, and the method will be accessible from any other class that can access the subclass.

## 2. Protected Access Modifier (protected)

### Abstract Class

If an abstract class is marked as protected, it can only be accessed by classes within the same package or by subclasses (even if they are in a different package). This is useful when you want to allow only a limited set of classes to inherit from your abstract class.

```java
protected abstract class Animal {
    // abstract class is accessible within the same package or by subclasses
}
```

### Abstract Method

If an abstract method is declared protected, it can only be implemented by classes in the same package or by subclasses (even in different packages).

```java
public abstract class Animal {
    protected abstract void makeSound();
}
```

**Note:** The `makeSound()` method will be available to subclasses (even in different packages) or within the same package. But classes outside this scope won't be able to access it directly.

## 3. Private Access Modifier (private)

### Abstract Class

You cannot declare an abstract class as private if it is a top-level class. This would make it inaccessible to any other class, which defeats the purpose of having an abstract class. The private modifier is only allowed for inner classes.

"Top-level class", It means a class that is not nested inside another class. In other words, a top-level class is the main class that is declared directly inside a file, as opposed to an inner or nested class, which is defined inside the body of another class

```java
// This is invalid as a top-level class cannot be private
private abstract class Animal { 
    // abstract class is not accessible outside this class
}
```

### ***"you cannot declare an abstract class as private if it is a top-level class", It means that a top-level class cannot be made private because it would make the class inaccessible from other classes, which is not allowed. However, a nested class (inner class) can be declared private because it is contained within another class and only accessible within that class.***



### Abstract Method

An abstract method cannot be private, as it needs to be accessible to subclasses for overriding.

```java
public abstract class Animal {
    private abstract void makeSound(); // Invalid: Abstract method cannot be private
}
```

**Important Note:** Abstract methods must be accessible to subclasses so they can be overridden. Therefore, private is not a valid modifier for an abstract method. You would generally use protected or public for abstract methods.

## 4. Default (Package-private) Access Modifier (No Modifier)

### Abstract Class

If you omit an access modifier for an abstract class, it will have package-private access by default. This means that the class can only be accessed within the same package.

```java
abstract class Animal {
    // abstract class is accessible only within the same package
}
```

### Abstract Method

If an abstract method has no access modifier (package-private), it can only be implemented by classes within the same package.

```java
public abstract class Animal {
    abstract void makeSound(); // package-private by default
}
```

**Note:** In this case, the method `makeSound()` can only be implemented by subclasses within the same package.

## Summary of Access Modifiers

| Access Modifier | Abstract Class | Abstract Method |
|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| public | Accessible from any package | Accessible and must be implemented anywhere |
| protected | Accessible within same package or subclasses | Accessible within same package or subclasses |
| private | Not allowed for top-level classes | Not allowed (abstract methods need to be accessible) |
| Package-private (default) | Accessible within same package | Accessible within same package |

## Important Points

* Abstract classes must be declared public or package-private (depending on the intended visibility), but not private or protected at the top level.
* Abstract methods must be declared public, protected, or package-private, but not private, because they must be overridden in subclasses.
